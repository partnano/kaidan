# MINZOKU

This is a RTS engine / game in it's absolute infancy. This project started because of my interest for the lockstep strategy and how it worked in implementation.

Much to do!

- libs/ is currently only a soft link in the directories -> bad
- useful build / run system for the project
- etc.
