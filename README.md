# Kaidan

This is a RTS engine / game in it's absolute infancy. This project started because of my interest for the lockstep strategy and how it worked in implementation.

(Lockstep, in short, is a method to do multiplayer without calculating the simulation on the server. Instead a deterministic client simulation is used.)

Much to do!

- useful build / run system for the project
- etc.
